# SR Research EyeLink
Compared to ASL:
  * high sampling rate
  * processed metrics in output (saccades, blinks)
  * different output (binary edf, text asc)
  * existing packages (R: `eyelinker`)


## Scoring strategies
Trails are scored based on where gaze goes as soon as the distracting dot is displayed. Trial latency is the time from pretension to the first saccade. The direction of the first saccade  determines the score: away = correct = 1, toward = incorrect = 0. A corrective saccade away from the dot after an incorrect is a "error corrected" (score = 2) trial.

### Eyelink saccades
A naive implantation that only looks at the saccades within a trial to get latency and score.

Using the saccades provided by EyeLink, trial scoring is reasonable. Most trials are correct (`73`), many are dropped (`20`), and, of the incorrect trials, most have a correction effort.
```R
run_stats(score_file(asc_fname='example/220682rr01.asc.gz'))
```

> # A tibble: 4 Ã— 4

>   <dbl> <int> <dbl>  <dbl>
> 1    -1    20 -971. 1504. 
> 2     0     3  476.  376. 
> 3     1    73  342.  104. 
> 4     2    16  230.   57.5


#### TODO:
 * look at saccade start and end positions to confirm motion should count toward the given score.
 * incorporate blinks to drop trials where the onset of the dot was not seen

### asl algorithm
The algorithm used for other studies applies to datasets collected with ASL. To work on EyeLink data, it must be downsampled to 60Hz and the x/y gaze space transformed to 261x261.


I suspect this will be more rigorous than the quickly implemented method using eyelink saccades. In particularly, the ASL algorithm is more likely to better identify drop trials (blinks, missing data). There's also more logic for assessing an error corrected trial.

The latency estimates will necessarily be lower resolution (due to downsampling). But I also expect SR Research's saccade detection to be more principled, and so the associated latencies would be more accurate even at a lower sampling rate.


#### TODO
 - filter blinks after downsampling. Missingness in original is interpolated
 - find rectangle bounds or recording grid to resample to ASL
 - compare this scoring to just using saccades as identified in edf file
